A compilation of code I have completed either for fun, or for coursework.

Creator Of Worlds-

Creator Of Worlds is my current NEA project for my A-Level computer science. It is currently a 2D level creator with the ability to play the levels in a platformer style. The project utilises the Python Arcade library as it provided a good basis for several aspects of the project. 
  Currently the project is in an alpha state. The level creator is fully functional, but needs a graphical interface as the only way to tell the currently selected block is a sprite in the top right hand corner of the screen. The user has the ability to save these files and load them using a custom format. The platformer is also functional, with the user controlling a sprite that can move around the screen collecting coins to be able to unlock and use the end goal.
  
  Future plans include:
    -GUI Overhaul of all current screens
    -Fix the camera so it is locked to the screen only in platformer mode.
    -Add server connectivity so the user can upload and download levels via an online database.
        -This will include the ability to search/filter levels based on tags/name.
        
  Stretch Plans:
    -Allow the level creator to be almost a small game creator with allowing the user to select different settings for their level/string of levels.

Miscellaneous-
A collection of older code

Top Down Shooter-

This was written in the pyret language, a python inspired language. This code was worked on for around a week as it was the basis for a different project. It is the basis for a top down shooter, with a mouse controlled 'ship' (represented by a triangle as this was before any assets were created), with the ability to shoot bullets. 

Microbit Program-

This is a small game I made for the BBC Microbit as I had the one I obtained in Year 7 still to hand. The game consists of a falling block that you have to catch with the movable paddle at the bottom. Pressing both the buttons at the same time, or letting the block drop to the bottom ends the game and shows the user's score. This required manipulating the LEDs on the Microbit to represent the paddle and block.

RPG Text Adventure-

This is a very small text RPG where you fight a monster to gain levels in 3 different catergories. The program was simple but it was a chance to relearn some python after the lockdown period following year 11.
